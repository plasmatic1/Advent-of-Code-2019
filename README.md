# Advent of Code

Hello lone traveller!

This is my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) solutions.  I'm solving the challenges in Ruby to learn more about the language and get used to the style of programming.

Cheers!

## How to place input

Input files should be at `input/<year>d<day>t<task>`

Here, `<year>` stands for the year, `<day>` stands for the day, and `<task>` stands for the task.  For example, if the problem was the 1st task from day 17 of 2018, the input file name would be `input/2018d17t1` (note the lack of file extension)
